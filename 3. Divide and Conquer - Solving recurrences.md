We will not do chapter 5. Instead, we will jump to chapter 6 after chapter 3. 
T(n) is a representation of time. 

For linear search
T(n) = 1 if n=1
if T(n) is larger than 1, T(n) = T(n-1) + 1
Therefore, T(n) = n

For Merge sort
T(n) = 1 if n=1
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + (n-1) if n>1
T(n) = nlog2(n)

Lets ignore boundary conditions and focus on other recurrences:

Binary Search
T(n) = T(n/2) + 1
So T(n) = log2(n)

Bubble Sort
T(n) = T(n-1) + (n-1) if n>1
so T(n) = n(n-1)/2

Towers of Hanoi
T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1 if n>1
so T(n) = 2^n - 1
