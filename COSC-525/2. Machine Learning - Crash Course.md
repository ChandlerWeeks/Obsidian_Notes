# What to touch on
Linear algebra and structured data.
Probability, review Bayes' Formula. 

The Bayes' Formula

posterior probability
P(w_j|x) = (p(x|w_j)*P(w_j)) / p(x)
x is any testing sample

w0 = probability of liking
w1 = probability of dislike
X = sample rating out of five

P(w0 | X=3.5) = 0.8
P(w1 | X=3.5) = 0.2

you are more likely to like the move based on the training sample
p(w_j) is prior knowledge, usually given to from domain knowledge. if classifying as undergrad/grad students, the ratio might be useful. 

Non-parametric Learning
- Estimate the density function without the assumption that the pdf has a particular form. KNN falls under this.
