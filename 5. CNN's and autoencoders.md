Shared weight - Using the same kernel to the entire image, in small chunks. 
Convolution Operator - weighted sum of the product, to extract certain features such as corners. 

1/3 \[1, 1, 1] -> example kernel. 

Using MNIST works on MLP, but CNN is more effective use of layers, and uses less weights to achieve a higher capacity in classification. 

Engineered features: explicitly designed by humans using domain expertise. 
Automatic features: Features learned automatically by the model through parameter optimization. 

Unsupervised learning - Autoencoder (AE)

Encoder-decoder -> take the input, encode it in the hidden layer, and decode in the output layer. 

Reconstructive loss compares the difference between the reconstructed output and the actual output. We find the weights to mimic the input. This is unsupervised learning. The loss is used to find a more compact representation of the input, for example clustering. An example is removing noise. s
