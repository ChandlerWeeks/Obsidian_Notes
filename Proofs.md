# Direct proof
If P -> Q
Uses an assumption, and manipulate that assumption for a proof. 

Ex:
If x is even, then x^2 - 6x + 3 is odd

Definition
If x is even, then x=2a for all integers, while an odd number would result in 2a+1
x^2 -6x + 3
(2a)^2 -6(2a) + 3
4a^2 - 12a + 2 + 1
2(2a^2 +6a + 1) + 1 is of the form 2a + 1, therefore the theorem assumption holds

The more of these you do, the more clear they become. In this case it takes algebraic manipulation. 
# Proof by Contradiction
P, assuming not P will result in a contraction such as (R and not R), which is impossible. 

If a is rational and ab is irrational, then b is irrational. 
a = m/n
