# Power
- Techniques to speed up multi-issue processors tend to increase power consumption more than performance.
- Issuing more instructions in parallel requires logic overhead that grows faster than the issue rate. 
- There is a growing gap between peak issue rates and sustained issue rate.
- Speculation is inherently inefficient since it's not perfect.
