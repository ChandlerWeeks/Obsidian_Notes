# Hardware vs. Software Speculation
Advantages of Hardware speculation
- better memory disambiguation
- better branch prediction
- reduces complexity of compiler
- binary code compatibility
Disadvantages of Hardware speculation
- More complex hardware design (space, energy overhead)
- Side channel attacks

# How Much to Speculate
- speculation is not free due to branch misprediction
	- Often causes more energy usage due to unnecessarily execute instructions and cost of recovery. 
	- Can potentially result in performance degradation, so only low cost exceptional events are allowed for speculative instructions. 
- Some additional complexity arises when speculating across multiple branches.
