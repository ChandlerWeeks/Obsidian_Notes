Multithreading allows multiple threads to share the functional units of a processor in an overlapping fashion. Modern processors support multiprocessing and multithreading. 

- Multithreading allows multiple threads to share the functional units of a processor in an overlapping fashion.
- The processor MUST save the state of each thread (register file, PC, stack pointer, condition codes) on a context switch. 
- Thread switches must be more efficient than process switches. 

**Thread Switches**: The process by which a CPU saves the state of a thread and restores the state of another thread, allowing the CPU to execute another thread. 

# Types of Multithreading
- Coarse-grained multithreading
	- Thread switches on costly stalls (L2 cache misses)
- Fine-grained multithreading
	- Thread switch on each clock cycle in a round robin fashion
- Simultaneous multithreading
	- Multiple threads run simultaneously by exploiting resources of a multiple issue, dynamically scheduled processor
