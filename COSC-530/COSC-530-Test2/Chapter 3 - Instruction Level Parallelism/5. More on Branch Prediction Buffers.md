[[8. Branch Prediction]] discusses various methods to predict taken branches, namely 1-2 bit predictors. 
# Correlating Branch Prediction Buffers 
Another approach is an (m, n) predictor, which uses the behavior of the last m branches to choose from 2^m branch predictors, each of which is an n-bit predictor. 

- m is a global history register, it stores the outcome of the last m branches taken globally.
- n is a local register, storing the outcome of the current working branch. 

(0, 1), (0, 2)  are just 1-bit and 2-bit branch predictors for example.
(2, 1) uses 2 bits to store what happened in the previous branches, and 1 bit for the current branch.

# Tournament Branch Prediction Buffers
Another type of branch predictor is a tournament branch prediction buffer, which also uses a global/local predictor, but also uses a 2-bit predictor which determines whether to use the results of the global or local predictor. Very flexible, with small overhead for space; very popular choice. 

# Comparison of Branch Predictors
Correlating branch predictors typically outperform noncorrelating branch predictors when using the same number of noncorrelating branches. This is because there is some correlation between branches. 

Tournament predictors generally perform slightly to moderately better than correlating predictors, and much better than local n-bit predictors for marginal additional space requirements.
