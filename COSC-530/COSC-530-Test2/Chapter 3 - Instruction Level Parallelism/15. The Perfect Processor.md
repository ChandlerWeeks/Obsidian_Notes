ILP has several limits that are interesting; One might ask "if we had a perfect processor, with no resource constraints, how many instructions could we execute simultaneously." This perfect processor would have infinite virtual registers for renaming, perfect jump and branch prediction, all memory addresses known, no cache misses, unlimited functional units, and only one cycle latency for each operation. A program was writen to trace the instructions and data references of a given program. Every instruction in the trace was scheduled as early as possible, only limited by data dependencies.

With this processor, the following results were seen:

Limits Preventing a perfect processor
- the number of functional units must be limited.
- The number of comparisons to check for issue dependencies grows quadratically.
- branch prediction can never be perfect
- cannot have infinite registers
- perfect alias analysis is impossible at compile time, and expensive at run-time.
- Cache misses and functional unit latencies must also be taken into account.
