One way we can extend dynamic scheduling is by implementing hardware based execution. 

Speculation combines three key ideas to further exploit instruction level parallelism:
1. Dynamic branch prediction
2. Speculative execution before control dependences are resolved. That is, we speculatively execute instructions before we know if the control flow will actually reach those instructions.
3. Dynamic schuedling of instructions - we can buffer and execute instructions OoO and on-the-fly. 

We will see that instructions on such a machine
- issue in order
- Can execute out of order
- update the state of the machine (commit) in order

# Speculative Tomasulo's
- Allows speculative execution with dynamic scheduling based on Tomasulo's algorithm. 
- Like Tomasulo's algorithm, allows instructions to execute OoO. 
- Unlike Tomasulo's, forces the instructions to commit in order.

**Advantages**:
- supports speculative execution
- Supports precise exceptions

The key idea of speculative tomasulo's algorithm is to allow instructions to execute out of order, but delay updates to the state of the machine until those updates can occur in order.
