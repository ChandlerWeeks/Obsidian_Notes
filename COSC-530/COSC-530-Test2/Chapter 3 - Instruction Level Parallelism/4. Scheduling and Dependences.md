Based on the Dependences in [[4. Dependences]], we know that dependences restrict movement of instructions and the order in which results must be calculated. 

**Reminder**: There are three types of dependences
- Data (true) dependence
- Name (anti and output) dependences
- Control Dependences
Compilers try to eliminate and separate dependence
Hardware tries to prevent dependence from becoming stalls

# True Dependences
Occur when the result of one instruction relies on another, leading to RAW hazards. Oftentimes cannot be reordered, but additional steps can sometimes be placed in between. Usually stalls. 

# Name Dependences
There are two types of name dependences

1) Antidependences, which occur when an instruction writes to a register or loaction after it is read.
2) Output dependences, which occur when an instruction writes a register or location after it is writen. 

Oftentimes these dependences can be avoided by the compiler renaming registers, so that names do NOT overlap.
