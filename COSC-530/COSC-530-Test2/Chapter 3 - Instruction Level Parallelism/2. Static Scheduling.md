Static Scheduling assumes there is no dynamic scheduling in the hardware, resulting on the burden going on the compiler. 

**Goal**: Keep the pipeline full by finding sequences of independent instructions that can be overlapped in the pipeline. 

If a hazard is detected, the instruction is stalled in the ID stage, and no new instructions are fetched until dependences are cleared. Compilers minimize stalls by increasing the distance between dependent instructions, and performing other transformations (register renaming).

### Latencies of FP operations
The effectiveness of static schedule depends on the latency of operations in the pipeline;
