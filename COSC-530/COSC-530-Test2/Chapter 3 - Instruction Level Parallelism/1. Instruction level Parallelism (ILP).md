Instruction level parallelism is the overlapping of instruction execution. There are two types of basic ILP

1. [[1. Instruction Pipelining - Introduction]]: dividing instructions into different stages and overlapping the execution in a processor pipeline. 
2. Multi-Issue ILP: perform the same stages of the pipeline on different instructions at the same time; analogous to a superscalar processor with multiple execution units. 

There are two approaches to exploiting ILP

1. Static: Handled by the compiler or software based
	1. not as essential, but used alongside hardware to boost performance, especially in high performance computing. 
2. Dynamic: Hardware based approaches to exploiting ILP
	1. The principle of modern computing; even phones utilize this.

How can ILP be measured? CPI. 

The ideal CPI for a pipeline with no stalls is 1, because we can complete 1 instruction each cycle. 

*Pipeline CPI* = Ideal CPI + structural stalls + data hazard stalls + control stalls
