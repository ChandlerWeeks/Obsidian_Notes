As mentioned in [[8. Dynamic Scheduling]], there are two methods for dynamic scheduling. These are Scoreboarding, and Tomasulo's Algorithm.

# Scoreboarding
- Issue
	- issues the instruction to the functional unit, and undates its internal data structure
	- Checks for structural hazards and WAW hazards
- Read operands
	- Monitors for source operands, read when available
	- checks for RAW hazards
- Execute
	- Execute the instruction in the functional unit
	- Notify the scoreboard when execution is complete
- Write Results
	- Writes the result to the destination register
	- Check for WAR hazards

# Tomasulo's Algorithm
- Two main features
	- Buffers instruction until their operands are available to minimize RAW hazards
	- uses register renaming to minimize WAW / WAR hazards
- Dynamic register renaming with reservation stations
- Two important properties
	- Hazard detection and execution control are distributed
	- Data values obtain directly from buffers or functional units via common data bus (CDB)
- Supports OoO execution and dynamic memory disambiguation.

*Figure shows the basic structure of a RISC-V processor unit using Tomasulo's.*

Each reservation station (RS) holds an instruction that has been issued, but is awaiting execution at a functional unit. 

## Instruction Steps using Tomasulo's Algorithm
1. Issue
	1. Get an instruction from instruction queue
	2. issue to an empty reservation station, send operands as well.
	3. Check for structural hazards
2. Execute
	1. Monitor the CDB until operands are available. When both operands are available, execute the operation.
	2. Check for RAW hazards
3. Write Results
	1. Write results on the CDB when its available
	2. Value is forwarded and stores in the reservation stations, waiting for the results.

**TDLR**: Dynamic Scheduling Summary
- Dynamic scheduling can yield high performance, but adds hardware complexity.
- Became popular for high-end processors in the 1990's
	- allows processors to hide unpredictable delays
	- efficient static scheduling became more difficult as processors
	- No need to recompile for for a different pipeline structure
