Value prediction attempts to predict the value that will be produced by an instruction; it is another form of speculation. 

Much of the research on value prediction is on loads
- Determine which loads are predictable by using profile data.
- Index into table using address of instruction to verify the previous load results for the instruction is in the table when the tag matches and speculate using last value loaded. 

Value prediction requires a recovery method when value is mispredicted. While relevant to research, it has never been successful enough to be incorporated into real processors.
