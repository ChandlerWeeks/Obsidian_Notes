To Support precise exceptions, or exceptions that have all previous instructions before the exception complete, the processor cannot simple handle an exception when it occurs in time. 

**IMPLEMENTATION**: 
- Hardware posts all exceptions for each instruction to a status buffer as it moves through the pipeline. 
- When an exception is indicated in this status buffer, any control signal that could cause a data value to be writen is turned off;
- After the instruction finishes MEM stage, but before WB, the hardware checks the status buffer. 
- Exceptions posted to the status buffer are handled in the order they would be received in an unpipelined processor.
