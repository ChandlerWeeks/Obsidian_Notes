Forwarding, also known as **bypassing** is a hardware technique to resolve data hazards. It works by routing the results of a previous instruction from a pipeline register to the next instructions execution stage, bypassing the destination register. This means instead of writing back, the data can be used bypassing the WB stage. It does this by copying the results of the EX/MEM and MEM/WB pipeline registers back to the ALU input. 

# Instruction Scheduling
In some cases, stalls can be avoided by reordering instructions. In this, instructions are reordered to be further away from each other. Most compilers only do instruction scheduling within a single basic block.
