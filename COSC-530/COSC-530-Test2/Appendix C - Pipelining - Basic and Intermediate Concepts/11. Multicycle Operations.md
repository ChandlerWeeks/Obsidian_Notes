Many operations, particularly those in high performance computing, require multiple cycles in the execution stage. For instance, Integer/Floating point multiplies/divides, and floating point adds and subtracts are often multi-cycle instructions; Really, any floating point operation will take multiple cycles. 

It would be impractical to do these operations in a single cycle, as they would take much longer for every CPU cycle, or more functional units. 

We assume that RISC-V uses four functional units in EX stage:

1. Integer unit, the ALU
2. FP and Integer multiplier
3. FP adder that handles FP add, subtract, and conversion
4. FP and Integer Divide

Multicycle operations might be completed quicker if they are not pipelined. non-pipelined multicycle operations can cause structural hazards,, back-to-back multicycle operations of the same type are relatively rare. 

There is still benefit to pipelining multi-cycle units however. We can divide the cycles into functional units as follows:

# Complications
- Structural hazards can occur
- multiple instructions may write to the register file in a single cycle
- WAW are now possible because instructions may no longer reach WB in order
- out of order completion of instructions may cause problems with exceptions
- stalls for raw hazards are longer and more frequent due to longer latency
