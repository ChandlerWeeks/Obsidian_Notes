As established in [[1. Instruction Pipelining - Introduction]], we determined that each stage in the pipeline cannot use the same hardware resources in the same clock. We also have to make sure that instructions in the pipeline do not interfere with each other. 

This is done by passing data and control information between stages in the pipeline using internal registers called **Pipeline registers** or **register latches**. At the end of each clock cycle, data resulting from the operations of the pipeline stages would be available in the pipeline registers. 

This is to prevent data from one instruction interfering with the next instruction.
