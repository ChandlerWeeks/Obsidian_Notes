An instruction is control dependent on a branch instruction if the instruction will only execute when the branch has a specific result. Also, an instruction that is control dependent cannot be moved before the branch, since it would change the results of registers, which could have bad results. 

Instructions that are NOT control dependent on a particular branch cannot be moved past the branch, as it could affect the correctness of the program. In most cases, compilers will not move instructions across branches, UNLESS it can prove doing so does not affect program correctness.
