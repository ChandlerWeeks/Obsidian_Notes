All approaches thus far have discussed eliminating stalls to make the number of CPI as close to one as possible. To make the CPI less than 1, we need to issue multiple instructions per cycle.

There are three methods to approach this issue
1. Statically scheduled superscalar
2. Very long instruction word
3. Dynamically scheduled superscalar

Issuing multiple instructions in parallel requires simultaneous actions to be performed for multiple instructions
- Fetching
- Decoding
- Executing
- Accessing memory
- Writing Results

# Statically Scheduled Superscalar Approach
- Issue varying number of instructions that can be quickly detected as independent.
- Typically, issue at most 2 to 4 instructions per clock cycle.
- If an instruction has a dependency, only the preceding instructions will be issued. 
- More likely to have hazards causing stalls.
- No increase in code size and less work for compiler
- Programs compiled from nonsuperscalar machines will still execute and have benefits. 

TLDR: These processors issue multiple instructions in each clock, and then do quick checks to determine if instructions are actually independent.
