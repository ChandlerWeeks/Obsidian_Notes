A well made ISA makes life easier for compilers; There are several properties that make ISA's well made for compilers, including:

**Regularity**: operations, data types, and addressing modes are orthogonal (independent of each other). For example, every operation should be supported by all addressing modes to reduce complex case management. X86 is bad at regularity, fuck X86. 

Primitive Implementation: Implement the basic features, and let the compiler handle the rest; Old VAX machines included garbage collectors, which was specific to one language; don't do this.

Present simple tradeoffs to the compiler writer: writing a compiler is a very complex task, anything the architecture can do to help the compiler make decisions will likely result in better code; 

Provide instructions for binding quantities known at compile time: Recomputing the same value over and over in innefficent; have a means to bind quantities we already know;
