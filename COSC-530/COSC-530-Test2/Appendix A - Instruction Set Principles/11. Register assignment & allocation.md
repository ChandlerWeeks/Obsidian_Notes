One of the most important tasks in the compiler is to allocate program values into architectural registers. There are two approaches for allocating registers:

1. Register Assignment: Assign temporaries to registers if there is a register available at any point.
2. Register Allocation: assign live ranges to registers: if two live ranges overlap in the source program, connect their nodes and store in registers?

Register allocation is most effective for stack data
Reserved registers for different sections of the process
- management of run-time stack
- dedicated register to point to start of global data
- one register dedicated to the PC.
