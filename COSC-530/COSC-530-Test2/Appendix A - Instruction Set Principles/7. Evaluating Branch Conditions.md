- Condition Codes (x86, ARM, SPARC)
- a special register, IC/CC, is set by the ALU, if the reuslts are negative the N bit is set to 0, and vice versa. Fast and cheap, but require extra states. 
	- IC = r[2] ? r[3];
	- PC = IC < 0, L1
- Condition Register (MIPS, Alpha)
- set a general purpose register to 0 or 1 depending on the comparison
	- r[1] = (r[2] < r[3]) ? 1 : 0;
	- PC = r[1] != r[0], L1;
- Compare and Branch (VAX, RISC-V)
- does the comparison and the branch in a single instruction, but the comparison results can't be used again. 
	- PC = r[2] < r[3], L1;
