*note*: PC relative means the target of the branch is represented as an offset to the current value in the Program Counter. 
# Direct Control Flow Transfers
## Conditional Branches 

Changes the program's execution if a specific condition is met. 
PC relative or immediat
## Unconditional Branches

Unconditional jump / goto statement; always jump
## Direct procedure calls

A standard function call my_function(); the compiler knows the functions location, making it immediate. 
# Indirect Control Flow Transfers
load an address into a register, and jump to the location in the register
## Returns
Exits a function, uses indirect branches because functions can be called from multiple locations. 
## Indirect Procedure Calls
Correspond to function pointers, where the address isn't known at compile time. 
## Large Switch Statements
A big "jump table", the target is loaded into a register. 

# Frequency of Control Flow Instructions
Conditional Branches are the most frequently occurring instruction, but can inhibit compiler optimizations and cause pipeline stalls; very important

# Branch Distance

The "gap" in memory between a branch instruction and the target instruction it jumps to; usually higher for floating points.
