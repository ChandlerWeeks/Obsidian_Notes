Memory Is Byte Addressable, meaning every single byte in memory has its own unique, sequential address. This is useful, so that a single byte can be accessed rather than a larger chunk, like a character, but not so specific that bits are accessed, which would require 3 bits to specify the bit. 

# Word and Word Size
Words are the standard size of most data; in older systems, these are 4 bytes. in modern systems they are 8 bytes. 

# Byte Order
Another design choice for a computer architecture is how bytes are ordered within a word; little endian means the first byte of the word is at the least significant position, while big endian means the first byte is in the most significant position. 

(7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)
na, na, na, na, na, 'r', 'a', 'c' <- Little endian
'c', 'a', 'r', na, na, na, na, na <- Big endian

# Word Alignment
An object is misaligned if its address is not an integer multiple of its size; one byte objects are always aligned, but 8 byte objects can only start at addresses that are multiples of 8. Because of this, they will always start with 000, or 00 for 2 byte words. 

Most machines have alignment requirements, and will raise an exception if objects aren't aligned properly. (sigbus). 

It is the responsibility of the compiler to ensure that data on the stack and in the static regions are aligned, compilers doubleword align each activation record and the first piece of global data, or use byte padding to ensure alignment is properly done.
