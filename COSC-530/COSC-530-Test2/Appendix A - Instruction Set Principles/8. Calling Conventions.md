Calling conventions is the standardized set of rules used by a compiler to manage procedure (function) calls; 

1. Identifying Registers for Special Purposes
	- Stack Pointer: a register reserved to manage the run-time stack
	- Return Address: a register designated to hold the memory address of the instruction the program returns to after the method is complete. 
2. Preserving the values of registers across calls
	- Caller save (scratch) registers - Values not preserved across a function call; 
	- Callee save (nonscratch) registers - values preserved across a function call. 
3. Transferring values between functions
	- Passing arguement values through registers and on the stack
	- returning values

Arguement order used to be right to left, so that routines could parse the strings first deciding data stack requirements; newer machines use left to right, since the first arguments are always passed in registers, and the first value is available to the callee.
