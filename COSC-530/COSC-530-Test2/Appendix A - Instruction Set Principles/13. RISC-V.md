RISC-V is the architecture used in this class, particularly the 64-bit version RV64G; it is relatively easy to understand, use, and *is used in the text*. 

The main emphasis of RISC-V is:

1. It has a simple instruction set.
2. Designed for pipelining efficiency.
3. Efficient as a compiler target. 

**Addressing Modes**
- Suppports immediate and displacement modes
- both modes use 12-bit operands
- can support register indirect and absolute by using 0 as an operand

# Instruction Types
## Loads
lw x1, 60(x2) load a word at 60 + memory_address_x2 into register 1
sw x3, 500(x4) store the value in x3 at 500 + memory_address_x4

## ALU
add x1, x2, x3 // add x2 and x3, store in x1

## Control Flow
beq x3, x4, offset // if x3 and x4 are equal, have the program counter move to the offset (PC + offset)
