Review Linear-Time Selection and its use in quicksort

Remember the call sequence 
- Partition
- quicksort
- quicksort 
For partition, the key is the median of medians which we can find the true median in linear time. 
This guarantees a logarithmic number of iterations. 
Quicksort is therefore, O(nlogn). 

## Lower Bounts on comparison based sorting
Proving a positive is almost always easier than proving a negative. an upper bound exists, but a lower bound has to happen for all algorithms. 

permutations to distringuish: n!
hiehgt of binary decision tree: log_2(n!)
Sterlings approximation: n! ~ $\sqrt{((2n\pi)*(n/e)^n)}$. Therefore
$$
log(n!) = nlogn - n + O(logn) = \Theta(nlogn)
$$
## Simultaneous Computation of Minimum and Maximum
Algorithm 1: simple scan
- Compare each element to current min/max, draw a comparison. 
- ~2n comparisons. 

Algorithm 2: Compare pairs first
- Compare elements at 1 & 2, 3 & 4, etc
- Leave smaller elements at odd locations, and larger elements at even locations. 
- Now scan these two sets separately. 
- 3n/2.
